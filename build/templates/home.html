            Boston is Massachusetts’ capital and largest city. Founded in 1630, it’s one of the oldest cities in the U.S.
            The key role it played in the American Revolution is highlighted on the Freedom Trail, a 2.5-mile walking route of historic
            sites that tells the story of the nation’s founding. One stop, former meeting house Faneuil Hall, is a popular marketplace.

            <p>“Boston’s Tap water rated the best in the country by national quality group”</p>
            <p>“I noticed that the water in Boston has a higher pH than most cities”</p>
            <p>“they recently switched over to chloramine and so aerating it to get rid of the chlorine doesn’t work and this high treatment causes the pH to be 9.2”</p>
